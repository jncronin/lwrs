Lightweight reliable serial (lwrs)

lwrs is designed for a specific use case, namely reliable (i.e. detecting and
recovering from errors) transmission of small data items over a serial link
(for example UART).  The only requirements are full-duplex communication.  In
theory SPI could be supported however the master would be required to
continuously poll the slave in order to ensure the slave is able to transmit
the required control sequences.

lwrs is designed to be lightweight - more so than the obvious alternative (lwip
with PPP).


The protocol is as follows:

Data is transmitted in packets.  Each packet comprises a header, the data and a
footer.

All data fields longer than 1 byte are transmitted in LSB order.

Header:

Start of packet (4 bytes): 0x12345678
Packet ID (4 bytes)
Protocol ID (2 bytes)   (equivalent to port number in TCP)
Packet size (2 bytes)   (size of header, encoded data and footer)

Data:
The data is transmitted in an encoded format:

Any bytes that are:
    0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x34, 0x35, 0x56, 0x57, 0x78, 0x79
are encoded as 0x11 followed by that byte
Other bytes are transmitted as-is

Footer:
Packet ID (4 bytes)
CRC32C of header, encoded data and footer with CRC field set to 0 (4 bytes)
End of packet (4 bytes): 0x13355779


Sequence of data transmission is:

A sends packet to B
B acknowledges with ACK
A acknowledges with ACKACK

If B does not acknowledge within a certain time period, or if B NACKs then A
resends the packet.

If A does not ACKACK within a certain time period, B re-ACKs
A does not ACKACK a NACK, merely resends packet with new packet id

ACK is header + footer without data.  Protocol ID is set to zero
NACK is header + footer without data.  Protocol ID is set to 0xffff.
ACKACK is header + footer without data.  Protocol ID is set to 0x8080


The default implementation does not queue packets for sending and the send()
function blocks until completion or error condition.
